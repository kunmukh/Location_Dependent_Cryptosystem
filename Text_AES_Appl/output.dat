Why should a fatal foresight damp our peace,
And all our short-liv’d miseries increase?
No—Providence has clos’d the book of fate,
And sight of future only comes too late:
We see not half the woes with which we cope—
They come, they overwhelm us—still we hope—
Yet woes come on, we drain the bitter cup;
But still we hope, and hoping bears us up.
So the poor trav’ller, o’er the dreary way,
Dark night o’erspreads—yet still he looks for day;
The forked lightnings flash before his eyes,
And torrents pour upon him from the skies;
The thunder rolls, the clouds are bursting fast,
Yet on he plods, and thinks it will not last;
He slips—he falls—amidst the tang’ling brake,
But not e’en this his hoping soul can shake;
Torn, wet, bespatter’d, out again he creeps,
And, weary’d on the bank, succumbent sleeps.
p. 14But to return—a council Titus calls,
To talk of peace, or fell the hardy walls.
First, Titus rises from his gilded throne,
And with a careless greatness all his own,
Bespeaks him thus: “Brave princes, Romans, men,
Who dare e’en brave the tyger in his den,
Your persevering courage meets my praise;
And could my words your well-known value raise,
The wond’ring world should echo with your names,
Old mew respect you, and the Jewish dames,
Whose spouses fall by you, your wrath approve,
Forget their wrongs, and only think to love;
All future ages will your deeds enroll,
And tell our victories from pole to pole.
But to our subject—Certain headstrong Jews
Have leap’d to power, and that pow’r abuse;
From conquer’d cities hither have they fled,
And threat to pour destruction on our head.
p. 15But let them threat, our armies, void of fear,
Grown great by conquest, challenge them e’en here:
Then princes say, shall we proceed with war,
Or make a peace, and so our arms withdraw?
What thinks my brother? he is cool tho’ brave,
Speak, Trajan, speak, your counsel let us have!”
Trajan arose:—“Do we or not love Rome?
We do, and punish all who dare presume
To mock that love, or of vain greatness boast:
Our conq’ring deeds are spread along each coast,
Our cheerful squadrons for the field prepare,
And willing all to die, they greatly dare.
Then think, my comrades, what would be their woe
If they return, and leave the vaunting foe;
Think how we all should lose our well-got fame,
And Jews and Romans join to tell our shame.
Observe, my friends, within the city’s verge
Dark clouds surround, and suck the tinted surge;
p. 16The thunders burst, whilst famine hoarsely sings,
And dark oppression claps his iron wings.
He who would sue for peace from such as these,
Or wish return to foul dishonor’d ease,
A coward I pronounce, and doubly base,
Will gain but hatred, and to Rome disgrace.”
So spake they round, till all but one had said,
Who, ’midst the numbers, hid his drooping head;
By name Placidus, Roman, brave and young,
Of noble mien, fair face, and gentle tongue.
Within his heart, young Cupid held his reign,
He lov’d a maid, and was belov’d again;
But ah! her parents would their love divide,
In vain she strove her rising love to hide,
They saw—and to another made her bride:
But bride alone she was, for on that day,
When all beside herself was free and gay,
p. 17The marriage rites scarce finish’d by the priest,
And vassals bustled for the promis’d feast,
The maiden fled, and to her what befell,
No one could dare suppose, no one could tell.
The fond Placidus wip’d his tearful eye,
Join’d in the war, and only sought to die;
To die with glory as a Roman ought,
For this he conquer’d and for this he fought.
And yet the fates denied him even this,
He wish’d for death, but death was too much bliss:
In vain he singly fac’d a line of foes,
In vain he fell—his faithful servant rose,
And sav’d a life, which yielded nought but woes.

Within the tent he heedless stands aloof,
Entranc’d from all but Titus’s reproof:
“Great sir (he cries) the world is nought to me,
And I’m content, if native Rome be free:
p. 18These are our foes; and ’tis a Roman’s pride
(For which what thousands of our friends have died)
To strive with all who would our pow’r withstand,
Or mar die honor of our native land.
Then let us on, and quell these daring fools,
Nor talking stand, nor calmly wait for rules;
I, with my band, will call them to the fight,
And hilt to hilt will quickly prove our right:
But if, like cowards, they the combat shun,
Or beaten by our army basely run,
Pursue them to the walls, our fortune try,
And nobly enter, or as nobly die.
There raise our banners in their very jaws,
Or fall together in the common cause.”
Each breast with double fury feels inspir’d,
No tongue but with Placidus’ praise is fir’d;
Titus himself with noble envy swells,
The man gives way, but yet the king rebels,
p. 19And thus he speaks: “Thy words and deeds are great,
But we are men, then wherefore tempt our fate:
He is but fool who of his lot complains,
Yet greater far is he who life disdains;
They only noble are whose deeds are good,
Whose virtues have the shocks of fate withstood,
Who fight their country’s battles as their own,
And die to gain them victory alone.
If such thy wish, and such thy pious thought,
If with such Roman aims thy breast is fraught,
Thy daring soul the giddy height shall soar,
Till, fully cloy’d, it drops to mount no more.
Yet if you meet that death you wildly seek,
And with bright honor’s scars thy frame grows weak,
Remember Titus, call him to thy side,
(He will not mock thy zeal, nor proudly chide,)
Pour in his friendly bosom all thy wrongs,
The fatal cause that now thy woe prolongs;
p. 20Repose in him, as friend, thy last request,
Or aught to give thy parting spirit rest;
And here he swears in face of all—of thee
To ’tend thy wish, whatever it may be.”
With heart o’erfill’d the lone Placidus bow’d,
And silent mix’d among the list’ning crowd.

Now round the tent the flowing goblet moves,
Some pledge their friends, and some their distant loves;
Nought but full pleasure can their hearts approach,
While flask by flask the sparkling wine they broach;
Glee, mirth, and laughter, with each bowl increase,
And ev’ry thought of bloodshed feels release.

Not so Placidus, destitute of joys,
He seeks his tent, and shuns their lively noise;
There sits him down, while on his mournful face
The love-lorn pearly shower falls apace.
p. 21Oft on his lost Paulina’s name he calls,
Oft casts his eyes around the strengthen’d walls,
Forebodings pleasing on his spirits flock,
He longs for death, nor fears the dreadful shock:
“But oh! (he cries) were fair Paulina here,
And with her love my dying hour would cheer,
I then resign’d should close my eyes to rest,
Shed my last fleeting breath upon her breast;
For her blest safety all the gods implore,
And haste contented to the dismal shore.
In vain my wish!—My faithful slave, draw nigh,
Let me have music—wherefore dost thou sigh;
You only know my grief, my gallant boy,
And thy soft tales alone e’er yield me joy;
For w
